Patterns
========

Design patterns are a collection of common solutions to solve common software development design problems

There are currently twenty-three patterns and they are grouped into three categories: creational, behavioral and structural. 

## Creational patterns

Creational patterns handle how objects are created. The purpose of creational patterns is to isolate a system from having any knowledge of how objects are created. This goes back to Object-Oriented Programming principles, in particularly encapsulation and abstraction.

### There are currently five creational patterns.

* Builder
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory
* Singleton
* Prototype

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns handle how objects interact. That interaction involves communication with one another, dependencies on one another, isolation from each other to be flexible, maintainable and testable.

### There are currently eleven behavioral patterns.

* Emplate Method
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Strategy
* Iterator
* Visitor
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* Interpreter
* State

## Structural Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

### There are currently seven structural patterns.

* Flyweight
* Composite
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Facade
* Decorator
* Proxy
